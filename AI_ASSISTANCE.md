# AI Assistance Log

This document outlines the AI-assisted development process for the Campus Event Management Platform.

## Development Approach

### Initial Planning
- **AI Tool Used**: Claude 3 Opus
- **Purpose**: Brainstorming system architecture and database design
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Chose FastAPI for its async support and automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Selected SQLite for simplicity with the ability to scale to PostgreSQL
  - Implemented multi-tenancy using college-based data isolation

### Database Design
- **AI Tool Used**: ChatGPT-4
- **Purpose**: Optimize database schema and queries
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Added appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Optimized join operations for reporting queries
  - Implemented proper foreign key constraints

### API Development
- **AI Tool Used**: GitHub Copilot
- **Purpose**: Accelerate API endpoint development
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Generated boilerplate code for CRUD operations
  - Suggested input validation patterns
  - Helped with error handling strategies

## Key AI-Generated Code Snippets

### Database Query Optimization
```python
# AI-suggested optimized query for event popularity report
query = """
SELECT e.event_id, e.title, e.type, 
       COUNT(r.reg_id) AS registrations,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM attendance a 
        WHERE a.event_id = e.event_id AND a.present = 1) AS attendance_count
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON r.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE e.college_id = ?
GROUP BY e.event_id
ORDER BY registrations DESC
"""
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
# AI-suggested error handling pattern
try:
    # Database operation
    result = await database.execute_query(query, params)
    return result
except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e:
    if "UNIQUE" in str(e):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Duplicate entry")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

## Deviations from AI Suggestions

1. **Authentication**:
   - AI suggested JWT tokens, but we implemented simple API key authentication via headers for the MVP

2. **Database**:
   - AI recommended PostgreSQL, but we started with SQLite for simplicity
   - Will add PostgreSQL support as a future enhancement

3. **Caching**:
   - AI suggested Redis for caching, but we deferred this optimization for later

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI as a Pair Programmer**:
   - Extremely helpful for generating boilerplate code
   - Great for suggesting best practices and patterns
   - Requires careful review for business logic implementation

2. **Limitations**:
   - Sometimes suggests over-engineering solutions
   - May not always consider the simplest approach
   - Requires domain knowledge to evaluate suggestions

## Future Improvements

1. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Containerize the application with Docker
